## Lox 

The programming language being built based on the book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).

I am using this book to more about building a programming language, so I can build my own programming language in the future.

## Instructions
After cloning the project and getting into the project,
- Run the lox prompt using ```java src/amodhakal/lox/Lox.java```
- Run a lox file using ```java src/amodhakal/lox/Lox.java [input lox file]```
